== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Portfolio Blocks? =
Portfolio Blocks is a collection of modern, responsive gallery and media blocks built specifically for the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg). You can create image and video galleries with advanced layouts like Grid, Masonry, Justified, Carousel, and more — all directly in the editor.

= Does Portfolio Blocks work with any WordPress theme? =
Yes. Portfolio Blocks is designed to work with all modern WordPress themes. For best results, we recommend using a block theme that supports Full Site Editing.

= What’s the difference between the free and Pro versions? =
The free version includes all the core blocks and functionality, but galleries are limited to 15 images or videos. The Pro version removes this limit and unlocks additional premium features such as Randomize Order, Image Downloads, Lightbox captions, Right-Click Disable, and more.

= Can I use Portfolio Blocks with page builders like Elementor or Divi? =
Portfolio Blocks is built specifically for the WordPress Block Editor (Gutenberg). It will not work inside Elementor, Divi, or other third-party page builders.

= Will Portfolio Blocks slow down my website? =
No. Portfolio Blocks is optimized for performance and loads only the scripts and styles needed for each block. The Pro version also includes Lazy Load support to further improve loading speed.

= Can I upgrade from the free version to Pro? =
Yes. You can install the free version from the WordPress plugin directory, and upgrade to Pro at any time. Your galleries will continue to work — you’ll simply unlock unlimited images and additional features.

= Do you offer support? =
Yes. Free users can post support requests on the WordPress.org plugin forum. Pro users receive priority email support directly from the developer.

= Can I use Portfolio Blocks on client websites? =
Absolutely. Portfolio Blocks is built with agencies and freelancers in mind. The Pro version offers licensing for single sites, 5 sites, or unlimited client projects depending on your plan.

= Will my galleries stop working if I deactivate the plugin? =
No, the galleries will remain in place on your site. However, the advanced layouts and features are powered by Portfolio Blocks, so deactivating the plugin will remove those.
